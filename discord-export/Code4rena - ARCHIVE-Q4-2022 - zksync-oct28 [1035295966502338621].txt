good morning, who (or which contract) will call *initialize* in *diamondInit*?


[10/30/2022 15:19] vladbochok
The DiamondProxy delegatecall the `diamondInit` in the constructor, it is a part of the proxy initialization

[10/30/2022 17:32] chaduke3730
@Vlad B | zkSyncthanks the constructor of DiamondProxy calls Diamond.diamondCut(_diamondCut), what does the _diamondCut look like as this the first diamondCut? (I din't see diamondInit in the constructor at this moment)


[10/30/2022 19:35] vladbochok
@chaduke Yeah, so in practice, we deploy the `DiamondProxy` with a diamond cut that contains `DiamondInit` contract address as initialization contact and corresponding calldata to call the `initialize` function from the `DiamondInit`. Regarding the facet cuts - just a list of all facets from the `ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets` (except `Base.sol` ).


[10/30/2022 20:40] chaduke3730
@Vlad B | zkSyncgot it thanks.


[10/30/2022 20:42] chaduke3730
I suppose Base is  used for inheriance ONLY


[10/30/2022 20:57] vladbochok

I have a question: For the test case, I see the test cases were written using hardhat and ts. I think for the POC, I will try to use it. But I am more productive if I write using Foundry. Does the project accept POC in Foundry also? Is there any limitation on the framework for POC? Thank you for answering.


[10/31/2022 03:14] wadefak04
what kind are you submit mate? i need some advice


[10/31/2022 03:17] birdy0219
Being a mere proof of concept I doubt it matters which framework you use, provided it interacts with the contracts appropriately and does indeed prove your exploit concept

do you guys have bridges deployed on testnets? I mean on goerli/rinkeby


[10/31/2022 09:20] zksync.ml
Yeah!


[10/31/2022 09:21] road220
can I use them to play around using tenderly?


[10/31/2022 09:26] zksync.ml
I think it is better that @bender-ml elaborates upon it.


[10/31/2022 09:32] road220
and also, where can I find tests for bridges? As I got it correctly, there is no any coverage yet 😦


[10/31/2022 09:41] road220
@Vlad B | zkSync , would you mind if i dm you?


[10/31/2022 10:46] benderml.
Interacting with testnet bridges is fine, but I strongly suggest that you use it to understand the way they work, not to try edge cases or exploits. Everything done on a public testnet is inherently public and will no longer fall under responsible disclosure. For example for zkSync v1 it is explicitly mentioned in our Bug Bounty here: https://immunefi.com/bounty/zksync/

> The following activities are prohibited by this bug bounty program:
> Any testing with mainnet or public testnet contracts; all testing should be done on private testnets


[10/31/2022 11:56] road220
simulations are also prohibited? Anyway, gotcha, thanks!


[10/31/2022 12:44] benderml.
I am not sure what you mean by simulations here. The rule of thumb is "do not do anything that may make a vulnerability or an exploit public".


[10/31/2022 12:54] vladbochok
Sure, go ahead


[10/31/2022 12:59] vladbochok
We use solpp preprocessor, idk how it works with foundry, and would suggest compiling via `yarn build` and then finding solidity files in a `cache/solpp-generated-contracts`. So, you can see contracts after the preprocessor and use them as you wish.


[10/31/2022 13:16] vladbochok
It is a bad idea, if you find something other contest participants may figure out the bug and reply to the report 🙂


[10/31/2022 14:45] soosh4618
Are the contracts deployed on Goerli testnet the same as the in-scope contracts? If I forked Goerli for a POC is it valid?


[10/31/2022 15:10] vladbochok
@Soosh Unfortunately, it is not the same. Small changes, but still no guarantee that we didn't change what you try to break

[11/01/2022 00:10] perseverancesuccess2021
Hello Zksync team, I have a question: So the document, it is stated that "bridges are completely separate contracts from the Diamond". so what is the proxy type do you intend to use for L1ETH Bridge and L1ERC20 Bridge? Can you specify the type of proxy you want to use and share the link to the source of proxy so that I can write the test cases for  L1ETH Bridge and L1ERC20 Bridge ?  Thank you.

Are users allowed to bridge any ERC20 tokens from Ethereum to zkSync permissionlessly, or tokens must be added to allowlist first by governor?


[11/02/2022 09:44] zksync.ml
Actually, allowlist just stores the users' permissions to call the function on different contracts, it does not whitelist any tokens. So, any ERC20 token can be bridged from L1 to L2.

The contest submissions will have public visibility once the report is completed. It's still in confidential status.


[11/10/2022 06:49] 0x_serial_coder
I meant while submitting the findings, there should be a web portal for you to edit your findings, right?

In my case, the web portal didn't display my findings. 

This was my second contest, but this problem happened in my first contest (blur contest) as well.

So, I'm not sure if this problem happened to others? Or did I miss something?

See the c4 leaderboard and you'll have a rough idea from it of how many users won any rewards


[11/12/2022 01:25] chaduke3730
